\*\*\*\*App name: OFF THE BEATEN PATH...

\*\*\*\*User Stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to create an app that will allow me to share my experiences from my travels around the world finding unusual, off the beaten path places to visit in different cities around the world. I want to share my own experiences, memories and suggestions to other frequent travelers to enrich their own travel experience. Visitors can send suggestions for cities they would like to see included on the site.

- As a developer, I would like to grow this site to a place where other travelers can share their experiences in the same cities.

-As a user, I want to see the site's logo displayed, a favicon in the tab, and to quickly be oriented by the visual display to know what this site is asking of me.

- I would like to quickly understand the environment by visual signage and clear web copy.

-I want to have clear options to click on different cities, and thereby view the page populated by that city's comments. This will be developed via EJS.

-I want to see an image of the city whose page I am on, and quickly apprehend the comments left behind by previous visitors to that city.

-I want to know that I can myself add a comment to this page, and that it will remain after I leave.

-If I am disappointed by the program's offerings as a user, I would like to have a means by which I can suggest additional cities to be added by development.

-I want to see a clear connection between the comments left and the city page that houses them.

--I want to see the site's database continue to populate and grow over time.

\*\*\*\*Brief Description of app:

Travelers often want to find hidden gems off the beaten path when visiting a new city. This site will allow users to get a glimpse at some recommendations from other travelers on where to go to find the hidden gems across the globe.

\*\*\*\*Stretch Goals:

- With further work, we would like to implement the following additions to the page:

- When choosing a city to review, the user would click on locations on a map instead of listing all options in a list.

- Give the user the option to create an account to comment on the city pages and leave their own suggestions. Users could then view the comments they have made and make changes or deletions.

- Search bar to enable users to search for a certain city.

- Suggestion input field that gives a 'thank you' pop up after suggestion is sent.

- Add more places to seed data.
